The mobile application "Erasmus Connect" is a platform designed to connect students who have participated in Erasmus exchange programs in different parts of the world. Upon registration and creating a profile, users can share their experiences through posts detailing aspects such as daily life, education, and lifestyle in the cities and universities they visited during their exchange.

Users can search for posts based on specific cities or universities they are interested in exploring. Additionally, the app offers a chat feature that allows users to communicate directly with each other to obtain additional information, address queries, or simply establish social connections.

The primary purpose of "Erasmus Connect" is to provide an easy and close-knit medium for students considering an Erasmus exchange to gather valuable insights and advice from individuals who have already gone through the experience. In this way, the app fosters community and knowledge exchange among international students, facilitating informed decision-making and providing support throughout the exchange process.

To build this application, we have utilized Google's Firebase as our database solution. Firebase offers a scalable and reliable solution for storing and managing user data, profiles, posts, and chat messages. With Firebase, we ensure real-time data synchronization and user information security, providing a smooth and secure experience for our users.
